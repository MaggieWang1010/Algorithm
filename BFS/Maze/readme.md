# Maze_Project

How can we find the fastest way from point A to point B? Solving problems like this is very common in computing. An enemy AI in a video game needs to be able to find the fastest way to the player. Google Maps needs to find the fastest way to your destination. Here, we just want to solve a maze.

There are several pathfinding algorithms. The one weâ€™ll focus on today is Breadth-first Search or BFS. This algorithm is guaranteed to give the fastest path on an unweighted graph.


Breadth-first search mothod to solve the maze questions.

# Problem
Robot with Wheel
The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling.
