# Maze_Project

In order to figure out how to traverse a maze through code, we first need to understand what Breadth-first search is. Breadth-first search (sometimes referred to in this article as DFS) is a graph/tree traversal algorithm that follows a path as far as it can until it either, reaches the goal or has nowhere else to go. For this project, I am going to work on two different situation, first one is robot without wheel,another one is robot with wheel.

Breadth-first search mothod to solve the maze questions.

# Problem
Robot with Wheel
The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling.
